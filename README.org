My collection of 3D-printable models designed using [[https://openscad.org/][OpenSCAD]].

* [[file:project_box.scad][Project Box]]
A parametric box for electronics projects using perforated circuit boards. The
board is held above the bottom of the box by four corner supports, and snaps
into place to hold it snugly while allowing easy removal.
