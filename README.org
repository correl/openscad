* [[file:project_box.scad][Project Box]]
A parametric box for electronics projects using perforated circuit boards. The
board is held above the bottom of the box by four corner supports, and snaps
into place to hold it snugly while allowing easy removal.

* [[file:ducky-shine-6-usbc.scad][Ducky Shine 6 USB-C Connector Housing]]
A replacement housing for the USB connector in a [[https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-Shine6][Ducky Shine 6 keyboard]] that
secures the connector and its wiring within the keyboard's case. The keyboard
originally ships with a USB Micro-B connector suspended in a solid connector
with the same profile. This makes it impossible to re-use the existing housing,
so this one is modeled to fit the cable along with a compact JRC-B008 USB-C
breakout board and screw into place. The model is divided into top and bottom
pieces that can be glued together once the board is in place and soldered.
